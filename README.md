# SummerProject
First GitHub repository and certainty not the last.

Hello world.

This is the start to my GitHub profile so spare me some leverage.
I have been coding since I first chose computer science for a GCSE back in ~2017
I first began my endevours in VB.net and have adventured out into Java, HTML and SQL.
Who knows, maybe my employer may read this some day.
